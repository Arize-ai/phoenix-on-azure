# Deploy Phoenix to Azure

Phoenix provides MLOps and LLMOps insights at lightning speed with zero-config observability. Phoenix provides a notebook-first experience for monitoring your models and LLM Applications by providing:

LLM Traces - Trace through the execution of your LLM Application to understand the internals of your LLM Application and to troubleshoot problems related to things like retrieval and tool execution.
LLM Evals - Leverage the power of large language models to evaluate your generative model or application's relevance, toxicity, and more.
Embedding Analysis - Explore embedding point-clouds and identify clusters of high drift and performance degradation.
RAG Analysis - Visualize your generative application's search and retrieval process to identify problems and improve your RAG pipeline.
Structured Data Analysis - Statistically analyze your structured data by performing A/B analysis, temporal drift analysis, and more.
